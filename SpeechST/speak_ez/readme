        speak_ez.lzh   				      26 SEP 1990

	This archive contains source code that is an example of how to
	interface your own programs with stspeech.tos.  The files
	speaksoz.c (for sozobon) and speakmeg.c (for megamax) will
	both produce speak.ttp. (I'm not really sure about the megamax
	version, but oh well :-)    

	I did not write this code but am just making it available.

	Stspeech.tos is also included and must be in the same directory
	as speak.ttp.  

	As an extra bonus I'm also throwing in heythere.c and heythere.ttp.
	Heythere.c is my speaking version of hello.c.

	I hope you have fun with this.
